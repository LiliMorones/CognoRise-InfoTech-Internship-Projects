Projects I completed during the CognoRise InfoTech virtual internship as a Data Analyst: 
### Tools: Power BI

## 1. Data Employee Salaries 
### Purpose: 
Analyze the range of salaries for employees in different data jobs, across countries, experience level,
type of job, etc., and determine which data job categories have the highest salaries across the world.

## 2. Cereals Analysis 
### Purpose: 
Analyze the nutritional facts for 80 different cereals in the market to realize which ones are the
consumerâ€™s favorites and if it has a relation to the sugar content for example.

## 3. Tour & Travel Customer Churn
### Purpose: 
Analyze the churn rate for tour and travel customers, and find if there is any relationship to the age of
the customer, annual income, or use of the services.
